## Heart-disease-prediction

This is a classification project since the variable to be predicted in binary (heart disease or not) Objective is here to predict whether a person have heart disease or not on the basis of user inputs.

## Details
We are building model with Balance data set and Random Forest.

## Usage 
we Need To provide inputs like Age,Stroke,Diabetic,Physical Activity,Smoking,Drinking,Gender,Asthma,etc. 
We Get Predicted Result on inputs like "You have Heart Disease please consult a Doctor" or " You Don't have Heart Disease" 
 
Example:

## Conclusion and Output
I Used different Models For Model Building like Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest and KNN but I got maximum Accuracy 96.88 in Random Forest. 

## DataSource
the dataset come from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health 
status of U.S. residents

## Credits
2020 annual CDC survey data of 400k adults related to their health 
status
